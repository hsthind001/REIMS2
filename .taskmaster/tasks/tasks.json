Accuracy-based adjustments:\n   - Table count factor: More tables = higher reliability (0.5-1.0 scale)\n   - Merged cell penalty: 5% reduction per table with merged cells (max 30% total)\n   - Formula: avg_accuracy × table_count_factor × (1 - merged_cell_penalty)\n\n3. Camelot-specific confidence scoring:\n   - _calculate_camelot_table_confidence() uses weighted average favoring higher accuracies\n   - Stores avg_accuracy, min_accuracy, max_accuracy in engine_metadata\n   - Generates warnings for tables with <80% accuracy\n\n4. Parsing accuracy features:\n   - Leverages Camelot's built-in parsing_report accuracy metric\n   - Whitespace analysis included in table metadata\n   - Confidence breakdown shows \"parsing_accuracy\" metric\n\n5. Test scenarios covered:\n   - High accuracy tables (>90%): High confidence\n   - Low accuracy tables (<80%): Reduced confidence with warnings\n   - Mixed accuracy: Weighted average calculation\n   - Merged cells detected: Automatic confidence penalty applied\n\nVerification: Confidence properly reflects Camelot's parsing accuracy and complexity.\n</info added on 2025-11-09T21:56:42.205Z>",
