			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Create Database Schema for Field Metadata",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks for designing the schema, implementing the migration script, and testing the migration.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a database schema involves designing the table structure, setting up foreign keys, and ensuring performance with indexes. Testing includes running migrations and verifying data integrity, which adds moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create SQLAlchemy Model for Metadata",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the task into creating the model class, establishing relationships, and implementing helper methods.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves translating the database schema into an ORM model, which is straightforward but requires attention to detail in defining relationships and methods. Testing CRUD operations adds some complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create Base Extractor Abstract Class",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline subtasks for defining abstract methods, creating the dataclass, and implementing helper methods.",
			"reasoning": "Developing an abstract class requires careful design to ensure extensibility and proper interface definition. The inclusion of a dataclass and helper methods increases the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Update PyMuPDF Extractor to Use Base Class",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Identify subtasks for refactoring the extractor to inherit from the base class and implementing confidence calculations.",
			"reasoning": "Refactoring to use an abstract base class involves modifying existing code and ensuring compatibility with new interfaces, which requires careful testing and validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Update PDFPlumber Extractor",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for refactoring the extractor and implementing table detection metadata.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to the PyMuPDF task, this involves refactoring and ensuring the extractor correctly implements the new interface, with additional complexity from handling table metadata."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Update Camelot Extractor",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Plan subtasks for refactoring, handling advanced parsing, and adjusting confidence calculations.",
			"reasoning": "This task is more complex due to the need to handle advanced table parsing and adjust confidence scores based on parsing accuracy, requiring thorough testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create Confidence Engine",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for implementing confidence calculation, conflict detection, and resolution strategies.",
			"reasoning": "Developing a service to aggregate confidence and detect conflicts involves complex logic and requires robust testing to ensure accuracy and reliability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create Metadata Storage Service",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline subtasks for implementing the service, handling transactions, and testing error scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves handling multiple engine results and ensuring data integrity with transaction management, which adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Metadata into Extraction Orchestrator",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Identify subtasks for modifying the orchestrator, implementing metadata capture, and ensuring rollback mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating metadata capture into the orchestrator involves coordinating multiple components and ensuring robust error handling, making it highly complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Create Confidence Indicator Frontend Component",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for designing the component, implementing the UI, and testing responsiveness.",
			"reasoning": "Developing a frontend component involves UI design and implementation, which is relatively straightforward but requires attention to detail for responsiveness and visual accuracy."
